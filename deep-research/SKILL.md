# Deep Research Skill

A comprehensive research-to-content workflow that transforms a topic and source links into deep analysis and multi-platform content.

## Overview

This skill:
1. Takes a topic and optional seed links as input
2. Conducts deep research using web search, social media (Twitter/X), and other platforms
3. Scrapes and saves all research to organized folders
4. Creates one-paragraph executive summaries for each source
5. Analyzes patterns, finds deep connections across all materials
6. Produces a comprehensive analysis document with insights and conclusions
7. Transforms the analysis into Twitter threads, blog posts, and YouTube scripts

## Directory Structure

```
INPUT/<YYYYMMDD>/<topic-name>/
  ├── sources/                    # Raw scraped content
  │   ├── web/                    # Web articles
  │   ├── social/                 # Twitter/X threads, posts
  │   └── other/                  # Other platforms
  ├── executive-summaries.md      # One-paragraph summaries of each source
  └── research-log.md             # Research process notes

OUTPUT/<YYYYMMDD>/<topic-name>/
  ├── analysis.md                 # Full analysis document
  ├── twitter-thread.md           # Twitter/X thread
  ├── blog-post.md                # Long-form blog post
  └── youtube-script.md           # YouTube video script
```

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Research (`/deep-research:research`)
Deep dive into the topic using multiple channels:
- Web search for articles, papers, news
- Twitter/X for threads, discussions, expert opinions
- Other platforms as relevant (Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.)
- User-provided seed links

**Input:** Topic name + optional seed links
**Output:** Organized source materials in INPUT folder

### 2. Summarize (`/deep-research:summarize`)
Create executive summaries:
- Read each scraped source
- Write one-paragraph summary (3-5 sentences max)
- Capture: main thesis, key evidence, unique insights
- Save to executive-summaries.md

**Input:** Scraped sources
**Output:** Executive summaries file

### 3. Analyze (`/deep-research:analyze`)
Find patterns and connections:
- Identify common themes across sources
- Find contradictions and debates
- Discover non-obvious connections
- Surface implications and predictions
- Determine what's novel vs established consensus

**Input:** Executive summaries + source materials
**Output:** Pattern analysis document (in PROCESSING)

### 4. Produce (`/deep-research:produce`)
Create final content outputs:
- **Analysis Document:** Full writeup with connections, insights, implications, and conclusions
- **Twitter Thread:** Distilled insights in thread format (5-15 tweets)
- **Blog Post:** Long-form article with narrative structure
- **YouTube Script:** Video script with visual cues and talking points
- **Viral Tweets:** Standalone viral tweets (10 tweets)
- **LinkedIn Post:** 3 LinkedIn post variants
- **Image Prompts:** 5-7 Midjourney/Imagen prompts for blog visuals

**Input:** Pattern analysis
**Output:** All content files in OUTPUT folder

**IMPORTANT - Blog Writing Guidelines:**
Before producing blog content, read and follow the blog writing standards in:
`apps/global-builders-club/CLAUDE.md` (see "Blog Writing Standards: Accuracy and Honesty" section)

Key requirements:
- Be accurate about source counts (e.g., "based on 8 sources" not "extensive research")
- Never fabricate timeframes (no "weeks of research" claims)
- Write as an informed synthesizer, not claiming personal expertise
- Cite actual sources used
- Avoid first-person claims of extended effort

**Timestamp:** Each output file should include a `generated_at` timestamp in the frontmatter or metadata section indicating when the content was created (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)

## Usage

### One-Step Full Workflow (Recommended)
```
/deep-research:full topic: "AI Agents" links: [url1, url2, url3]
```

Runs all phases automatically: Research → Summarize → Analyze → Produce

### Individual Phases (Manual Control)
```
/deep-research:research topic: "AI Agents" links: [url1, url2]
/deep-research:summarize
/deep-research:analyze
/deep-research:produce
```

📄 **`apps/global-builders-club/CLAUDE.md`** → "Blog Writing Standards: Accuracy and Honesty"

Summary of key rules:
1. **Accurate source counts** - Say "analyzed 12 sources" if you analyzed 12, not "extensive research"
2. **No fabricated timeframes** - Never claim "weeks of research" or "months of investigation"
3. **Synthesizer voice** - Write as someone synthesizing research, not claiming personal expertise
4. **Specific citations** - Link to actual sources used
5. **No exaggeration** - Let quality speak for itself; avoid inflating credibility
