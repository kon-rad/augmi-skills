# {Headline — compelling, specific, SEO-friendly}

{Hook paragraph — lead with the most surprising fact, stat, or claim.
Draw the reader in within 2 sentences. No throat-clearing.}

## {Section 1: The "What" — What's happening}

{Set the context. What's trending and why it matters right now.
Use data from research. Cite sources.}

## {Section 2: The "Why" — Why it matters}

{Go deeper. What are the implications? Who does this affect?
Connect dots between different sources. Show non-obvious patterns.}

## {Section 3: The "So What" — What to do about it}

{Actionable insights. What should builders/creators do?
This is where the AUGMI angle comes in naturally.}

## What This Means for Builders

{1-2 paragraphs connecting the topic to the broader trend of
AI agents and autonomous technology. Keep it natural — don't
force the connection if it doesn't fit.}

{Soft CTA paragraph: "If you're ready to start building with AI agents,
AUGMI makes it simple — deploy your own AI agent in minutes at augmi.world."}

## Writing Guidelines

- **800-1200 words** total
- **Hook-first** — most interesting claim in the first sentence
- **Synthesize, don't list** — weave insights together, don't just enumerate facts
- **Data-driven** — include stats, numbers, trends from research
- **Accurate source counts** — say "based on 8 sources" if you used 8
- **Never fabricate timeframes** — no "weeks of research" claims
- **AUGMI angle should feel natural** — if the topic is loosely related, keep the CTA minimal
- **Conversational tone** — write like you're explaining to a smart friend
- **No corporate jargon** — never say "leverage", "enterprise-grade", "comprehensive suite"
