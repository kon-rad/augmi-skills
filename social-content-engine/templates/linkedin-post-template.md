# LinkedIn Post Template

## Structure

```markdown
# LinkedIn Post: {Topic}

{Hook line — the most compelling 1-line claim or observation.
This line appears before the "...see more" truncation, so it must
be strong enough to earn the click.}

{Blank line — forces LinkedIn to truncate here}

{2-3 paragraphs of substance:
- Paragraph 1: Context and "why now"
- Paragraph 2: Key insight or data
- Paragraph 3: What builders/professionals should do about it}

{Brief Augmi mention if natural:
"At Augmi, we're making AI agent deployment accessible to everyone.
If you're curious, check it out at augmi.world."}

{Engagement prompt: "What's your take? Have you started building with AI agents?"}

## Image Prompt

{Detailed image generation prompt for 16:9 aspect ratio LinkedIn image.
Professional but not boring. Should complement the post's message.
Include: subject, setting, style, lighting, composition.}
```

## Writing Guidelines

- **150-300 words** — long enough to add value, short enough to read
- **Hook line is critical** — LinkedIn truncates after ~150 chars on mobile
- **Professional but not boring** — match the "builder" voice
- **Use line breaks generously** — walls of text get skipped
- **Data and specifics** — "AI agent market grew 340% in 2025" beats "AI is growing"
- **3-5 hashtags** — at the end, not inline
- **Ask a question** — drives comments which boost reach
- **First-person perspective** — "I've been watching..." or "Here's what I noticed..."

## Tone

- Think "smart friend at a tech conference", not "corporate thought leader"
- Okay to be opinionated
- Share genuine insight, not promotional fluff
- Augmi mention should feel like a natural aside, not a pitch

## Hook Patterns

1. **Observation**: "Something shifted in AI this week that nobody's talking about."
2. **Stat lead**: "340% growth in AI agent deployments. Here's what's driving it:"
3. **Contrarian**: "Hot take: Most AI tools are solving the wrong problem."
4. **Personal**: "I spent the weekend building an AI agent. Here's what surprised me:"
5. **Question**: "What happens when AI agents can hold their own crypto wallets?"

## Image Prompt Guidelines

The LinkedIn image prompt should produce a 16:9 image that:
- Looks professional and polished
- Works as a post header image
- Conveys authority and insight
- Uses clean composition with tech/futuristic elements
- Avoids looking like generic stock photography
- Style: photorealistic or high-quality digital art
