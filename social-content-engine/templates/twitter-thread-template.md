# Twitter Thread Template

## Structure

```markdown
# Twitter Thread: {Topic}

1/ {HOOK — most compelling claim, question, or stat. This tweet determines
whether anyone reads the rest. Make it impossible to scroll past.}

2/ {CONTEXT — why this matters right now. Set the scene.}

3/ {INSIGHT 1 — first key finding or data point. Be specific.}

4/ {INSIGHT 2 — second finding. Build on the previous tweet.}

5/ {INSIGHT 3 — the non-obvious angle. The thing most people miss.}

6/ {EXAMPLE or PROOF — real-world case, stat, or quote that proves your point.}

7/ {IMPLICATION — what this means for the future. Make a prediction.}

8/ {CTA — what should people do about this? Follow, build, check out Augmi.}

## Writing Guidelines

- **Every tweet under 280 characters** — verify before finalizing
- **Tweet 1 is everything** — spend 50% of effort on the hook
- **Each tweet is self-contained** — someone should get value from any single tweet
- **Use line breaks** — break tweets into 2-3 short lines for readability
- **Include numbers** — "73% of developers..." beats "most developers..."
- **No hashtags in the thread** — save for a reply if needed
- **End with engagement** — ask a question or prompt a reply
- **Thread length: 5-10 tweets** — don't pad, don't truncate

## Hook Patterns That Work

1. **Contrarian**: "Everyone thinks X. They're wrong. Here's why:"
2. **Data shock**: "73% of [group] now [surprising behavior]. Here's what that means:"
3. **Future claim**: "[Thing] will change everything about [industry]. Thread:"
4. **Story opener**: "Yesterday [thing happened]. It reveals something massive:"
5. **List promise**: "I spent [time] researching [topic]. Here are [N] things I learned:"

## CTA Patterns

- "If you're building with AI agents, check out @augmi_world"
- "Follow for more on AI agents and the future of building"
- "What's your take? Reply with your experience"
- "RT if this changed how you think about [topic]"

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't start with "Thread:" or "1/" — let the content hook
- Don't use corporate language
- Don't make every tweet about Augmi — max 1 mention in the thread
- Don't pad with filler tweets
- Don't use more than 1 emoji per tweet
