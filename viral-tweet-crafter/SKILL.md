## Context Loading

**CRITICAL**: Before crafting any tweet, ALWAYS read the latest versions of these files to ensure alignment:

```
SELF/mission-statement-and-values.md     # Mission and core values
SELF/GOALS/LIFETIME/                     # Ultimate life goals
SELF/GOALS/TEN_YEARS/                    # 10-year vision
SELF/GOALS/YEAR/                         # Current year objectives
SELF/GOALS/RESEARCH/top-1-percent-ai-founder-plan.md  # Community building strategy
```

If any file is missing, proceed with the core principles below.

## Tweet Types

### 1. The Builder's Log (Build in Public)
Share what you're working on, learning, or struggling with.

**Format:**
```
[What you did/learned today]

[Insight or lesson]

[Question or CTA to engage community]
```

**Example:**
```
Today I spent 4 hours debugging an AI agent that kept hallucinating function calls.

The fix? Better system prompts, not more code.

Lesson: With AI, clarity of instruction beats complexity of implementation.

What's tripping up your AI projects right now?
```

### 2. The Democratization Manifesto
Challenge the status quo about who can build technology.

**Format:**
```
[Contrarian statement about technology access]

[Evidence or example]

[Vision of the future you're building]
```

**Example:**
```
Hot take: The best developers in 2030 won't have CS degrees.

They'll be artists, teachers, and kids who learned to direct AI agents.

We're not just changing how software is built. We're changing WHO can build it.

That's the mission.
```

### 3. The Teaching Moment
Share knowledge that empowers others to build.

**Format:**
```
[Specific technique or insight]

[Why it matters]

[How to apply it]
```

**Example:**
```
The #1 skill for working with AI coding agents isn't coding.

It's writing clear instructions.

If you can explain what you want to a smart 10-year-old, you can build software with AI.

Start here: describe your app in 3 sentences. That's your prompt.
```

### 4. The Community Spotlight
Celebrate and elevate community members.

**Format:**
```
[Shoutout to person/project]

[What they accomplished]

[Why it matters to the mission]
```

**Example:**
```
Shoutout to @[community_member]

They just built their first app using AI agents—with zero prior coding experience.

A teacher. Building software. In a weekend.

This is what democratization looks like. More of this.
```

### 5. The Progress Report
Share milestones that prove the vision is working.

**Format:**
```
[Milestone achieved]

[What it means]

[Gratitude + next step]
```

**Example:**
```
Just hit 500 YouTube subscribers.

5 months ago: 0
Today: 500 people learning to build with AI

Small numbers, but 500 potential builders who didn't exist before.

Thank you. Now let's get to 1,000.
```

### 6. The Contrarian Take
Challenge conventional wisdom in your space.

**Format:**
```
[Controversial opinion]

[Your reasoning]

[The implication]
```

**Example:**
```
Unpopular opinion: Most "learn to code" content is teaching the wrong thing.

In 2026, you don't need to memorize syntax. You need to:
- Think in systems
- Write clear requirements
- Direct AI agents

The curriculum is broken. We're fixing it.
```

### 7. The Personal Story
Share authentic moments that reveal your humanity.

**Format:**
```
[Vulnerable moment or struggle]

[What you learned]

[How it connects to mission]
```

**Example:**
```
I quit my job to build something that might fail.

Some days that's terrifying. Today was one of those days.

But then I remember: the goal isn't to avoid failure.

It's to give ordinary people extraordinary capabilities.

That's worth the risk.
```

### 8. The Thread Teaser
Set up a longer-form thread.

**Format:**
```
[Bold claim or question]

[Promise of value]

[Thread indicator]

🧵
```

**Example:**
```
I've spent 100+ hours building with AI coding agents.

Here are 7 lessons that took me from confused → productive:

(Saving you the painful mistakes I made)

## Engagement Principles

### DO:
- Ask questions that invite responses
- Respond to every reply in first 2 hours
- Quote-tweet community wins with your commentary
- Share failures as openly as successes
- Tag people who inspired the thought (when genuine)
- Use line breaks for readability
- End with clear CTA when appropriate

### DON'T:
- Chase trends that don't align with mission
- Dunk on competitors or critics
- Brag without adding value
- Post for posting's sake
- Use engagement bait that feels inauthentic
- Forget the education mission

---

## Posting Strategy

### Best Times (adjust for your timezone)
- 6-7 AM EST: Early morning builders
- 12-1 PM EST: Lunch break scrollers
- 5-6 PM EST: End of workday
- 8-9 PM EST: Evening engagement

### Weekly Cadence
- **Monday**: Builder's Log (start the week)
- **Tuesday**: Teaching Moment
- **Wednesday**: Contrarian Take

### Engagement Rule
After posting, stay active for 30+ minutes responding to replies. Early engagement signals to algorithm.

## Quality Checklist

Before posting, verify:

- [ ] **Mission-aligned**: Does this serve the democratization mission?
- [ ] **Value-adding**: Will readers learn something or feel inspired?
- [ ] **Authentic**: Would I say this in person to my community?
- [ ] **Clear**: Can a non-technical person understand this?
- [ ] **Engaging**: Is there a hook? A question? A reason to respond?
- [ ] **Humble**: Am I teaching or bragging?
- [ ] **Community-building**: Does this strengthen or fragment?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Content That Doesn't Fit Your Mission
- Crypto speculation or price talk
- Political hot takes unrelated to tech democratization
- Negativity about other builders (compete on building, not tearing down)
- Humble-bragging disguised as teaching
- Generic motivation without specific value

### Tone Violations
- Arrogance or "guru" energy
- Desperation for engagement
- Inauthenticity (saying what you think people want to hear)
- Complaining without constructive framing

## Generating Tweets

### From a Topic
If user provides a topic:
1. Read SELF folder for latest context
2. Determine which tweet type fits best
3. Frame through mission lens
4. Generate 2-3 variations
5. Recommend best one with rationale

### From Scratch
If user wants general content:
1. Read SELF folder for latest context
2. Check recent goals and progress
3. Generate one of each type relevant to current phase
4. Let user choose or combine

### From Content
If user provides content to share (article, video, milestone):
1. Extract key insight that aligns with mission
2. Frame as teaching moment or progress report
3. Add community engagement element
4. Provide 2-3 angle options

---

## Hashtag Strategy

### Primary (use 1-2 per tweet)
- #BuildInPublic
- #AIAgents
- #LearnToCode
- #TechEducation

### Secondary (use occasionally)
- #IndieHacker
- #StartupLife
- #AITools
- #NoCode

### Avoid
- Trend-chasing hashtags unrelated to mission
- More than 3 hashtags per tweet (looks spammy)

---

## Metrics That Matter

Track these, not vanity metrics:

1. **Replies per tweet** (community engagement)
2. **Followers gained who match target audience** (builders, educators, aspiring developers)
3. **DMs from people wanting to learn/join** (community growth)
4. **Quote tweets with thoughtful additions** (thought leadership)
5. **"How do I start?" questions** (reaching the right people)

---

## Integration with Goals

### Yearly Goal Alignment (2026)
- Every tweet should support: YouTube growth, augmi.lol awareness, thought leadership in personal AI coding agents

### Community Building Phase
- Currently in Phase 1 (Audience Building)
- Focus: Convert followers to community members
- Every tweet should have path to deeper engagement

### The Daily Question
Before each tweet: "Does this help one person feel they can build something?"

If yes → post
If no → revise or skip

## Remember

You're not building a following. You're building a movement.

Every tweet is a small act of democratization—sharing knowledge that was once gatekept, celebrating builders who were once excluded, and proving that the future of technology belongs to everyone.

Tweet like the movement leader you're becoming.
